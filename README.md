# Overview of Election-Audit
The Colorado Board of elections entrusted Tom, Seth and I with some important data and to help out the city of Denver. Tom and Seth needed help analyzing and looking through the votes to confirm the outcome of the election. As we combed through the data there was clearly a definite winner.
# Election-Audit Summary
As we analyzed the data, we came to find out the clear winner in this election. 
  1) During this election there was a total of 369,711 votes. The population for this city was quite small (could be a possibility of people not voting).

 2) Looking at the picture above we can see the votes for the different counties. Looking at this shows how the votes were broken down. Jefferson and Arapahoe showed a small percentage of votes. 
 3) With the huge show out/population of 306,055 votes for Denver this was the obviously the deciding county for the election and they showed to favor one candidate.

4) Here we see the 3 candidates and their percentage/# of votes. Diana DeGette had the most votes by a huge margin. With 73.8%/272,892 # of votes Diana seemed to be the most wanted candidate for the people of Colorado. The last 2 candidates Charles and Raymon had a small %/# of votes with only making up 26.1%/96,819 # of votes. 
5) Diana was the clear winner out of the 3 candidates, and she has won the election. With a outstanding 73.8%/272,892 # of votes, there was no one standing a chance going against Diana. The audit was a success and the people wanted Diana as the #1. 

#Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used with future elections with minor modifications. Making it easy for anyone (Tom, Seth, or myself) to check the results of any future elections. Once we have access to the csv with the information it will be just a easy change of importing the file. We can also add the smallest county turnout and possibly find out why there was such a small turnout from that county. Maybe this can help even out the candidate race instead of having someone win by a landslide.
